# Web Based Painting
Coursework from University of Hertfordshire

## Overview
I had to develop an interactive painting program using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The web paint app had five main features, such as selecting eight different pre-set colours, a custom colour blend tool, an eraser, different pre-set brush sizes and a clear option.
